# admn5016-finalproject
Final Project for Applied Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence course

<b> Team Members: </b> <a href = "github.com/eyas01">Eyas Abu Elhouf </a> & Katrina Ong

<b> Proposal: </b>

We have chosen a dataset containing data about diamond characteristics and their corresponding prices. The dataset contains 53,940 samples with 10 features which include carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, price in dollars, x (length in mm), y (width in mm), and z (depth in mm).  
We plan to build a machine learning model using Sci-kit Learn to predict diamond price using its corresponding characteristics as the input variables. We will be exploring different prediction models and selecting the model with the best performance.
