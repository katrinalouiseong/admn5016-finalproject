# admn5016-finalproject
Final Project for Applied Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence course

<b> Team Members: </b> <a href = "https://github.com/eyas01">Eyas Abu Elhouf </a> & Katrina Ong

<b> Proposal: </b>

We have chosen a dataset containing data about diamond characteristics and their corresponding prices. The dataset contains 53,940 samples with 10 features which include carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, price in dollars, x (length in mm), y (width in mm), and z (depth in mm).  
We plan to build a machine learning model using Sci-kit Learn to predict diamond price using its corresponding characteristics as the input variables. We will be exploring different prediction models and selecting the model with the best performance.
This particular dataset allows diamond dealers or jewelry stores in predicting the price for their products. In general, price prediction can be used on any product.
